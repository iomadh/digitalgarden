Last.fm shows different types of events through my music listening choices.

The [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm) Velocity [Lab](https://www.last.fm/labs)  compares your top artists' cumulative scrobbles over time.so a flatline is not listening at all over a long time, whilst a vertical line is like listening to that artist non stop all day.

Firstly, it's pretty easy to spot the year, Mark E. Smith died.  I'd kind of fallen out of love with the Fall and had moved onto to different music.  However, the grumpy man's deat rekindled my love of the music he made.

Secondly, it shows more or less when I decided that Morrissey's political views meant I could no longer listen to his music
