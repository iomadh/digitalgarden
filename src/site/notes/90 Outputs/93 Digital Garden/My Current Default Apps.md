## My default apps in  2024

📨 **Mail Client:** *Gmail* and *Mail* (in iOS and MacOS)

📮 **Mail Server:** *Google and my domain providers servers*.  I'm slowly weaning myself off Google and GMail but seen as I've had it since it was in beta this will take a lot of time and effort

📝 **Notes:** *Obsidian*

✅ **To-Do:** *Obsidian* A custom built GTDish system using the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin
 
📷 **Photo Management:** *Synology Photos* Previously Google but see GMail above.  Just started setting up a new system with the Photos tool on my Synology NAS.  Again, it will take time

📆 **Calendar:** *Google Calendar*

📁 **Cloud File Storage:** *iCloud*

📖 **RSS:** *FreshRSS* and *NetNewsWire* I run a self hosted instance of FreshRSS with NNW clients.  Works very well.

🙍🏻‍♂️ **Contacts:** Hmm, just on my phone I guess

🌐 **Browser:** *Firefox*, *Safari* and *Chrome* when I have to

💬 **Chat:** Well, it's what others use. I have one friend on *Signal*, others on *WhatsApp*, family tend to be FB *Messenger* :( 

🔖 **Bookmarks:** A self-hosted instance of *LinkDing* which is similar to Pinboard but without the iffy owner.

📑 **Read It Later:** This would have been *Omnivore* but the creators sold out and crashed the app.  Now, its a combo of using LinkDing and Obsidian Web Clipper

📜 **Word Processing:** Only use a word processor for work when it is *MS Word*

📈 **Spreadsheets:**  *Excel*

🛒 **Shopping Lists:** I default this with Apple *Reminders* I have a shared list with my wife.

🍴 **Meal Planning:** I consistently fail to plan my meals

💰 **Personal Finance:** *YNAB*

📰 **News:** *BBC* (although it is biased), *The Guardian* (although it is problematic too and the Scotland coverage is pathetic), *RSS* and  *Mastodon*.  I try (and fail) to avoid it.

🎵 **Music:** *Spotify* is a family account which I'd cancel if it wasn't for the kids

🎤 **Podcasts:** 

🔐 **Password Management:** 

⌨️ **Blogging:**

**Health:**  



📞**Video calls:** Teams
