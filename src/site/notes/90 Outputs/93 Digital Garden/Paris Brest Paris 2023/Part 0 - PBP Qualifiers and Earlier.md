# Part 0 - PBP Qualifiers and Earlier

## 2022 Pre-qualifiers, Injury and Illness

2022 was a problematic year for me and cycling.  I knew I needed to get a good pre-qualifier in so I had a better chance of 

- find details  about rides
- broken bike after och hills
- add in back injury from george bike 
- new bike
- illness but successful last-minute 200.  in the end it was a lucky result as it meant I could get a 6:30 time as those getting a 400 got a later time and they opened up a few slots
