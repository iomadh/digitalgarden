## Notes
- Isaac has the ability to shift his face to mimic others
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/02/2024-02-10\|2024-02-10]] Bellatine has the embers which can bring inanimate objects to life, for a few seconds. For some reason she thinks she is a monster because of this ability. Her mother told her to keep it private but I thinks it is great
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/02/2024-02-12\|2024-02-12]] still getting some [[Stephen King\|Stephen King]] vibes, travelling across America chased by the "Longshadow Man" - could be [[99 Old/Backlog/60 Indexes/62 Books/The Stand\|The Stand]] -- but with a house with chicken legs its not all Stephen King
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/02/2024-02-12\|2024-02-12]] Bellatine embering has the ability to renew her, so she drank the longshadow poison but was able to recover quickly
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/02/2024-02-16\|2024-02-16]] there was an attack on the house but whilst there was a lot of damage it was possible to escape. Isaac left and somehow that was the reason LM was able to contact B via a dream 
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/02/2024-02-17\|2024-02-17]] we get what we think is a dream but I dies. T knows and takes b to him and she brings him back to life. Get the full story of the birth of T but I’ll need to reread as it doesn’t get fully explained 

## Review

I enjoyed this book, and there is a lot of great things about it but it didn't hang 100% together for me.  I was unsatisfied by the ending.  I felt cheated as a reader that to defeat the Longshadow Man they had to do exactly the Longshadow Man's only objective.   Still, I loved Bellatine as a character, and wish it was her story alone.  I was sad that she thought she was a monster and happy that she was about come to terms with her powers and wish she could have got to live her happy life at the end in Thistlefoot.  I did not enjoy the sections with Isaac.  He felt underdeveloped and under used, as did Shona and the rest of bus gang.  Why was the way Benji died such a big deal to Isaac?  The way I read it, it was a complete accident, so would have been good to delve more into why he thought it was his fault.  I also wanted a lot more for Winnifred as I was really interested in her as a concept and character.   

I know virtually nothing about the backstory of Baby Yaga but it did make me want to find out more.
