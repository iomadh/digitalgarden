## Notes
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/02/2024-02-22\|2024-02-22]] start of book seem remarkably similar - have I read this book before?  Or is it very similar to another book?  Maybe a [[99 Old/Backlog/William McIlvanney\|William McIlvanney]] ?
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/02/2024-02-25\|2024-02-25]] next sections were completely unfamiliar so must have been a different book and I can’t place it
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/03/2024-03-02\|2024-03-02]] Lorimer seems to have gotten over his mental health crisis rather easily and quickly. There wasn’t much description of the treatments 
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/03/2024-03-06\|2024-03-06]] I might take back the mental health part because the acknowledgements referenced the actual police facility that the description is based on.  This was a good standard crime drama.  The gangster and the corrupt police officer situation was wrapped up too neatly, but them both doing stupid things, but the main story was a good one.  However, Lorimer didn't solve anything in that part of it, just the commanding officer that was efficient enough to let the team do the work (and helped by a random appearance by a high level officer just stepping in.)  Even in the corrupt officer plot, Lorimer didn't uncover it, it was Cameron, Lorimer did the action part at the end.
