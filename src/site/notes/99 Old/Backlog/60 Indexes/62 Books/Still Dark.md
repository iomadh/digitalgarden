## Notes
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/02/2024-02-22\|2024-02-22]] start of book seem remarkably similar - have I read this book before?  Or is it very similar to another book?  Maybe a [[99 Old/40 Databases/41 Entities/41.01 People/William McIlvanney\|William McIlvanney]] ?
- [[10 PMS/11 Daily Notes/2024/02/2024-02-25\|2024-02-25]] next sections were completely unfamiliar so must have been a different book and I canâ€™t place it
