[The Black Archive](http://obversebooks.co.uk/theblackarchive/) is a series of books about Doctor Who, specifically books about specific episodes of Doctor Who.

> Book-length investigations of single Doctor Who stories

I discovered The Black Archive via Dale Smith on Mastodon 
In august, it looks like Dale wrote a book about the Silence in the Library

In October I'll have some money to buy it and review here
